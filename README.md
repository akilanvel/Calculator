# Calculator

This program is a calculator which can compute addition, subtraction, multiplaction, and division. The program prompts input from the user, which should be entered in this format:
NUMBER (space) OPERATION (space) NUMBER
For example, "5 + 5" is a valid command for the calculator.

Solutions to previous calculations are saved in the program. So after at least one operation, entering "+ 7" will add 7 to the answer of the last operation and return the solution.
